        <h2>Types of Tea</h2>
        <div class='tea-type'>
            Green tea
            <blockquote>
                Green tea preserves some of the original qualities of the fresh leaf, while heightening them and rounding them out.
                It's made by cooking the fresh or briefly withered leaves to inactivate their enzymes, then pressing them to release their moisture,
                and drying them in hot air or on a hot pan.<sup>*</sup>
            </blockquote>

        <div class='tea-type'>
            Black tea
            <blockquote>
                Black tea is made by allowing a profound enzymatic transformation of the leaf fluids. The leaves are withered for hours, rolled repeatedly for as much as an hour,
                then are allowed to rest for between one and four hours&hellip; Finally, the leaves are air-dried at temperatures around 100&deg;C, and become quite dark.<sup>*</sup>

        <div class='tea-type'>
            Oolong tea
            <blockquote>
                Oolong tea is made by allowing some modest enzyme transformation of leaf juices. The leaves are withered
                until they become significantly wilted and weakened. Then they are lightly agitated to bruise the leaf edges, allowed to rest 
                for a few hours until enzyme action has turned the bruised edges red, pan-fired at a high temperature, rolled and finally dried gently&hellip;
                 Oolong tea brews to a light amber color with a distinctive fruity aroma.<sup>*</sup>
